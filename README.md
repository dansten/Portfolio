# Portfolio
Selected projects I've worked on the last (couple of) year(s).

## Contents
* **PythonMarkovChain:** An example of how to predict and simulate the price of stocks or other financial derivatives (in this case Ethereum) in Python, using theory in discrete markov chains and statistical modelling.
* **RLogisitcRegression:** A project from the course FMSN40 where logisitc regression was used to understand the impact of personal charasteristics and diet on plasma concentrations of beta-carotene, written in R.
* **TensorflowCNN:** A simple example of how to use a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for image classification. The project took advantage of mainly Tensorflow, Numpy and Pandas.
